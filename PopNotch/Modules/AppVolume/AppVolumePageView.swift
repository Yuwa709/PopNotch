/// Those two use the player's own AppleScript `sound volume` (decision 3),
/// which needs no tap engine, and their rows share state with the player
/// screen's slider through `ScriptedPlayerVolumes` — moving one moves the

/// (`BassBoostButton`). Neither changes the row height, so choosing an
/// output or a boost never resizes the panel.
