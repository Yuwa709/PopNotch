/// curve and filled straight down to a flat base on the row's bottom edge — an
/// upward-only envelope. Toward each end it tapers down to the silent bar's
/// height and finishes in a round cap, like the old capsule's ends. Progress
/// is carried by colour: the accent left of the playhead, grey right of it,
/// with a hard edge between. Within each, brightness follows the spectrum
/// horizontally, and vertically fades from each column's crest down to the
/// base, which is what gives the wave body rather than a flat fill. The played
/// side also carries a soft bloom in the same accent; the grey carries none.
///
/// Always drawn, whatever the visualiser is doing, because it is the scrub
/// bar. Switched off, refused permission, paused, or between tracks, the
/// service's `bands` are all zero and the wave lies flat at its minimum
/// height: a plain progress bar. On a pause they get there over a short
/// settle rather than in one frame; see
/// `AudioVisualizerService.pauseSettleDuration`. Capture itself is still gated by the
/// service (enabled, playing, player screen visible); only the drawing is
