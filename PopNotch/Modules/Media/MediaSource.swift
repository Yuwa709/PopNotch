/// 16.7ms, 2 properties 33ms, the eight-field query **167ms median**. That

/// here may run on a tight cadence and why a live poll reads three
/// properties, not eight. Compiling ahead saves ~16ms per call; it is not
/// the lever. The one other slow case is the first-ever call, which blocks
/// on the system permission dialog — user-driven and one-time.
