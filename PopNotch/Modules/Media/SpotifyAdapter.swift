/// Reads and controls Spotify.
///
/// Metadata arrives two ways:
/// - **Push:** Spotify broadcasts `com.spotify.client.PlaybackStateChanged`
///   as a distributed notification on every track/state change, with title,
///   artist, album, duration, and position in userInfo. No polling, no
///   permission needed.
/// - **Pull:** an AppleScript query fills in what the notification lacks —
///   initial state at launch and the artwork URL. Apple Events need the
///   Automation permission (one system prompt, first call).
///
/// Artwork itself is an image fetch from the URL Spotify's scripting
/// interface hands us — a network call permitted by the hard rule 6 decision
/// recorded in PROJECT-CONTEXT.md. `artwork url` is the only usable route:
/// the dictionary's `artwork` property is image data that Spotify does not
/// populate, so reading it yields nothing.
///
/// What this dictionary cannot do, verified against `sdef`:
/// - **No queue.** There is no playlist, context, or queue class. `next
///   track` is a *command* that skips; it returns no data. `upNext` is
///   therefore always nil here, and never derived by skipping.
/// - **No favourite state.** `starred` is in the dictionary with
///   `access="r"`, but Spotify does not implement the handler: reading it
///   throws **-10000 (errAEEventFailed)** against the live app, measured
///   2026-08-28. It was briefly in the query script and took every other
///   field down with it, because AppleScript aborts the whole `return`
///   expression when one property fails — which is how nine working fields,
///   artwork included, were lost to one unimplemented term. Favourite is
///   therefore `.unsupported` here, not `.readOnly`. Do not re-add it.
