/// scripting dictionary, this source reports the same session Control Center
/// shows: Spotify, Music, a browser playing video, anything that registers
/// with MediaRemote.
///
/// **Why a subprocess and not `MediaRemoteClient`.** MediaRemote's read API is
/// gated to entitled callers, which is why `MediaRemoteClient` sits unused in
/// this folder (see the note in `MediaSource.swift`). The gate applies to the
/// calling binary, so a separate tool that satisfies it can read the session
/// and hand the result over as plain JSON on stdout.
///
/// Lifecycle mirrors `SpotifyAdapter`: push-first, no timers. The tool is
/// launched once by `startObserving()` and streams a line per change for as
/// long as it runs, so this satisfies hard rule 9 without a suspend path —
/// there is nothing polling to suspend. `stopObserving()` terminates it.
///
/// What this source cannot do: the adapter exposes no queue and no
/// favourite, so `upNext` and `favorite` keep the protocol defaults (nil and
/// `.unsupported`). It is not an oversight and must not be faked by peeking
/// at another player.
