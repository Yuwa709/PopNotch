# CFBundleShortVersionString and CFBundleVersion come from these two build
# settings (GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE synthesizes the plist from them); neither

# Overriding them here is what makes CFBundleVersion match sparkle:version in
# the appcast, since generate_appcast reads CFBundleVersion out of the app.
#
# CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-" makes the build itself ad-hoc. Without it, Automatic
# signing picks the Apple Development certificate, which is a personal
# credential that must never ship. The explicit re-sign below is belt to this
# braces: it guarantees the identity regardless of project settings.
#
# CLANG_COVERAGE_MAPPING=NO keeps coverage instrumentation out of the release.
# No scheme is committed, so xcodebuild generates one, and that scheme injects
# CLANG_COVERAGE_MAPPING=YES into every configuration it builds — Release
# included. Up to 1.0.6 that shipped profile counters and the LLVM profile
# runtime, and left a default.profraw in the working directory on exit.
# A command-line override outranks the scheme. Test runs never pass through
# here, so they keep coverage. The binary is checked for it below.
#
# No `clean`: it is not needed for correctness and risks removing the SPM
# artifacts that generate_appcast lives in.

# --- ad-hoc sign, inside out -------------------------------------------------
# Order matters: nested code must be signed before its container, or sealing
# the container captures a hash that the later nested signature invalidates.
#
# --preserve-metadata=entitlements on the Sparkle components: Autoupdate ships
# com.apple.application-identifier, and re-signing without it would silently
# drop it. The app instead gets its entitlements file explicitly, because
# com.apple.security.automation.apple-events is load-bearing — Hardened Runtime
# refuses Apple Events without it and the media feature dies with a silent
# -1743, no prompt and no Automation pane entry.
FRAMEWORK="$APP/Contents/Frameworks/Sparkle.framework"

# Release-only entitlement, derived here rather than added to the checked-in
# file so Debug builds stay unweakened.
#
# WHY IT IS REQUIRED: Hardened Runtime turns on Library Validation, which
# demands that every loaded library share the main executable's Team ID.
# Ad-hoc signatures have NO Team ID, so an ad-hoc app cannot load its own
# ad-hoc framework and dyld refuses with "mapping process and mapped file
# (non-platform) have different Team IDs" — the 1.0.0 launch failure. Signing
# inside-out with one identity does not fix it, because the problem is the
# absence of a team, not a mismatch between two.
#
# Disabling library validation is the narrow fix: it drops that one check and
# keeps the rest of Hardened Runtime (DYLD injection blocking, unsigned
# executable memory). Dropping `-o runtime` instead would fix the launch too,
# but forfeits all of those.
#
# REMOVE THIS when a Developer ID exists: signing app and framework with the
# same real identity gives them a matching Team ID, library validation passes
# on its own, and this entitlement becomes an unnecessary weakening.
